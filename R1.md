## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode

### Day 1: January 5 Sunday

I learned the basics of how Gatsby works in the last two days and used a starter to develop my personal website.
I chose this framework because I want a static website, I'm already familiar with React and I want to dig deeper into GraphQL.
I connected hosting on Netlify to the repository on GitHub for continuous deployment.

### Day 2: January 6 Monday

I worked on my website template.

### Day 3: January 7 Tuesday

Worked on tags, template and content.

### Day 4: January 8 Wednesday

The website is published.

### Day 5: January 9 Thursday

I took a look at some examples of D3.js to improve my chart development skills with this library.
